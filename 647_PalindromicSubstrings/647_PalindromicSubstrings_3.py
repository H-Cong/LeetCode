    # The number of possible palindromic centers is 2nâˆ’1: 
    # there are n single character centers and n-1 consecutive character pairs as centers.
    # Each center can potentially expand to the length of the string, 
    # so time spent on each center is linear on average. 
    # Thus total time spent is n(2n-1) ~ n^2
