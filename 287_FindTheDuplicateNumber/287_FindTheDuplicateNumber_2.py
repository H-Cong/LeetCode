    # TC: O(n)
    # Set in both Python and Java rely on underlying hash tables, so insertion and lookup have
    # amortized constant time complexities. The algorithm is therefore linear, as it consists 
    # of a for loop that performs constant work n times.
    
    # SC: O(n)
    # In the worst case, the duplicate element appears twice, with one of its appearances 
    # at array index n-1. In this case, seen will contain nâˆ’1 distinct values, and will therefore
    # occupy O(n) space.
