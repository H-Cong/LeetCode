    # TC: O(n)
    # Since each node in the tree is visited only once, the time complexity is O(n), 
    # where nn is the number of nodes in the tree. We cannot do better than that, 
    # since at the very least we have to visit each node to invert it.
    
    # SC: O(n)
    # Because of recursion, O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the 
    # worst case, where hh is the height of the tree. Because h âˆˆ O(n), 
    # the space complexity is O(n).
    
    # IDEA: essentially, we are just inverse first parents nodes, then inverse the child
    # node of each parent.
