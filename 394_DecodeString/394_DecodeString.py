    # We traverse a string of size nn and iterate k times to decode each pattern of form    
    # k[string]. This gives us worst case time complexity as O(maxKâ‹…n).
    
    # SC: O(m+n)
    # where m is the number of letters(a-z) and n is the number of digits(0-9) in string s. 
    # In worst case, the maximum size of stack could be m+n
